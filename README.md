# CodingChallenges
Rex's various crazy unorganized coding challenge answers


This is a testing repo so Rex can upload his coding challenges and set up an automation repo within it. This is primarily in Ruby.

############### To Do List ###########
1) Successfully connect my Ruby Automation scripts to jenkins so I can trigger it there
  - This may require a run file? I need to investigate more
  - I may also need to connect a project or something
  
2) Create a Ruby Gems file
3) Set more goals
4) Learn how to create webhooks in Jenkins that execute some of the files in here
